I'm an IT student in Norway trying to do fun stuff with tech, so you'll see very few public repos here, especially while i work on projects - partly because they won't all be things i want public or are references for myself/automation.

My currently non-public skill roadmap is on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/card/tall/6786540a7dbe4fb02675304d?variant=dark&roadmaps=cyber-security%2Cpython%2Ccpp%2Clinux). (These are some of my top skills there)

Otherwise im 'just a silly lil guy' that you can contact via carnx@duck.com or any other website/sm you find
