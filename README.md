I'm an __IT student__ in Norway trying to do fun stuff with tech, so you'll see very few public repos here, especially while i work on projects - partly because they won't all be things i want public or are references for myself/automation

I work on a lot of different stuff with **NO** real *persistence*. This is among the reasons there arent many public repos - other reasons include self doubt and related mental issues.

Some other projects and stuff is only available on other sites such as Tumblr/Twitter/Discord and may have limited public visibility for various reasons --- (You should filter for tags on Tumblr, I do a lot of shit on sm's)

Otherwise im '*jus a silly lil guy*' that you can contact via carnx@duck.com or any other website/sm you find

A lil short list about me:
1. He/They
2. Goober
3. Degen
4. Faggot \:3
5. Probably either interested in something youre interested in or able to talk about it
6. Socially inept and emotionally mangled

I have a skill roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/u/sillies) btw (Some of my top skills there vv)

[![roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/card/wide/6786540a7dbe4fb02675304d?variant=dark&roadmaps=python%2Ccpp%2Clinux%2Ccyber-security)](https://roadmap.sh)

### I'd like to specify that the age of repos here is highly relevant. If its old, its bad and ive probably come far from it even if its the most recent repo within a given lang/theme/project/schema/framework
